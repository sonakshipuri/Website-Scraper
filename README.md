# Website-Scraper
 This Python script is designed to scrape book data (title and author) from the Audible website's charts page. It uses the `requests` library to fetch the HTML content and `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML and extract the relevant information. The scraped data is then saved to a CSV file.
